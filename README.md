# Simulations_penalizedclr
Files for reproducing  simulation study for article: **penalizedclr: an R package for penalized conditional logistic regression for integration of multiple omics layers**

This repository contains the following files:
1. simulation_study_setup_and_run.R that contains functions that generate data, simulation settings and a function that runs simulations
2. simulation_results.rds that contains intermediate  simulation results
3. Tables_Figures.R that provides the code for results presentation
In addition, code for estimating alternative high-dimensional logistic regression models is provided in
4. ipf-lasso-simulations.R
5. clogitL1.R
  Code for running a simulation study for different sample sizes is given in
6. Different_n.R
